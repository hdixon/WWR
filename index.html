            <p><b>Wireless World Radio</b> is bringing you stories of all flavors &#8211; from the ordinary yet hectic narrative that happens behind the scenes planning a big party to thinking about deeper questions on the edge of human knowledge.
                <br>
                <br>Wireless World was formed by a small group of Carnegie Mellon University students to tell great stories. Walking around a college campus like CMU's, you notice glimpses of cool things happening all around you. One thing that makes
                CMU unique is that everyone is working to build something: professors are developing self-driving cars with GM and Uber, artists are using technology to make robotic structures capable of holding the weight of a person, and researchers
                are making discoveries in every corner of academia which push our world forward.
                <br>
                <br>But Wireless World is not merely about notifying the world that someone at CMU did something cool. Wireless World is about stories. It's about weaving a narrative formed by science, technology, art, people, and relationships that say
                something about what it means to be human.
